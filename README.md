# Ramjet-Analysis-Aircraft-Propulsion

The following analysis is a parametric study over a ramjet/scramjet propulsion performance.  The parametric study involves varying several key input parameters and visualizing the effects on the key propulsion characteristics & efficiencies.  The main script conducting the analysis is `Aircraft_Prop_Project.m`, the script is iteratively running the funtion file `Ramjet.m` for each input varied.  `ramjetOptT.m` is a optimized ramjet function file used for one part of the analysis.

## Requirements
- MATLAB 2019 or version ++
